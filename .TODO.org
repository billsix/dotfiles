**** Learned today about GPU memory, and pushing data from main memory to GPU memory.
**** Learned about task-parallell vs data parallel, and the advantages of hetergenious computing.
**** Learned about how threads determine which data they should act upon without having them explictly pass parameters
**** Learned that memory transfer operations are blocking, but tasking kernel threads are not blocking
Like threads, or like linux "sync", sometimes you need to make a call to block to ensure
all threads have finished their work on the GPU before the CPU should resume.

*** TODO Logicomix, by Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos H. Papadimitriou
*** TODO Vector Calculus, by Susan Jane Colley
*** TODO Linear and Geometric Algebra, by Alan MacDonald
This book is hard but good, I should start from the beginning again and do all exercises
*** TODO Vector and Geometric Calculus, by Alan MacDonald
*** TODO Extension Theory, by Hermann Grassman
This is the foundation for a lot of multivariate work, and Clifford expanded
on Grassman's and Hamilton's work to create geometric Algebra.  In particular
I want to see the section on inner products, as for instance in Geometric Algebra,
I still don't know how to take the dot product of a vector and a bivector, without
resorting to upgrading them to a geometric product minus the wedge product
*** TODO Geometric Algebra for Computer Scientists, by Dorst et. al.
*** TODO That Geometric Algebra book that I have on Kindle, it's good.
*** TODO Foundations of Geometric Algebra Computing, by Hildenbrand
*** TODO Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus, by Hestenes and Sobczyk
I'm looking forward to getting to understand enough of the material to take this
book on
*** TODO New Foundations in Mathematics, Sobczyk
*** TODO An Introduction to Geometric Algebra and Geometric Calculus, M.D. Taylor

**** Learned today about GPU memory, and pushing data from main memory to GPU memory.
**** Learned about task-parallell vs data parallel, and the advantages of hetergenious computing.
**** Learned about how threads determine which data they should act upon without having them explictly pass parameters
**** Learned that memory transfer operations are blocking, but tasking kernel threads are not blocking
Like threads, or like linux "sync", sometimes you need to make a call to block to ensure
all threads have finished their work on the GPU before the CPU should resume.

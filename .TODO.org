***** Learned today about GPU memory, and pushing data from main memory to GPU memory.
***** Learned about task-parallell vs data parallel, and the advantages of hetergenious computing.
***** Learned about how threads determine which data they should act upon without having them explictly pass parameters
***** Learned that memory transfer operations are blocking, but tasking kernel threads are not blocking
Like threads, or like linux "sync", sometimes you need to make a call to block to ensure
all threads have finished their work on the GPU before the CPU should resume.
**** <2023-08-22 Tue> Through page 61
***** Learned that for matrix addition, that the block and grid size affects perfomance
I'm not quite sure why, but the book says chapter 3 will explain it from a hardware perspective
**** <2023-08-23 Wed> Chapter 3
Learning about how the threads within a certain subgroup all have the same instruction executed,
and stalls are used on branches not taken in that thread affects performance, was interesting to read
about.  Learning about how the hardware actually works is interesting, but it's a lot to take in.
I think the grid/block/thread stuff will all make more sense once I run cuda on datasets that I care
about, using nvprof, or the graphical visualizer.
**** <2023-08-23 Wed> Up to chapter 4
Chapter 3 was interesting, especially about warps.  I had no idea how much work is required
to get optimal performance.  I'm curious now to reread my openGL books, especially the section
that talk about compute shaders.  I remember reading those sections years ago and having no idea
what was going on.  But now that I know a bit more about graphics hardware, and how it's used
for general purpose computation, perhaps those sections will make more sense to me now.  Or
perhaps I should read up on OpenCL as well.

This is the foundation for a lot of multivariate work, and Clifford expanded

I still don't know how to take the dot product of a vector and a bivector, without
resorting to upgrading them to a geometric product minus the wedge product

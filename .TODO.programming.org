** TODO quaternion
*** <2023-11-26 Sun>
Made better variable names
*** <2023-11-24 Fri>
This morning got part of it working in tex.  I need to make variable names rather that copy expressions.
*** <2023-11-24 Fri>
Made some progress this morning, almost got a rough draft of the proof for the parrallel
section
*** TODO replace the repeated calculations with sine and cosine, and list out the properties better
*** TODO do the perp section
*** TODO finish devirvation
*** TODO make animation
Make view rotate while the two axes look stationary because the camera is moving
** TODO Calculus book from gutenberg
*** TODO get working on modern systems (images on build on my rpi)
** VLC
*** DONE get working on mac, fix issue of expanding folders
<2024-08-10 Sat> For the life of me, I cannot build VLC on mac.
The issue is that when using upnp, (at least), when you expand
a folder, it starts automatically playing the first item.
This is infuriating.
I cannot build on a 2020 intel based mac, I cannot build
on my 2022 macbook pro.  I switch to Kodi, because it works.
*** TODO [#10] Android - see if I can make download work like on iOS

<2024-08-10 Sat> Not gonna do that anymore.  I'd rather rip my CDS to mp3

*** TODO [#1] Rewrite rotate, and update explanations.
**** TODO Do it by making relative number lines
**** TODO Add in _add_ method to add vertices
**** TODO define translate by add
**** TODO rotate should be implemented using add, to scaled vectors

*** DONE fix warning of matplotlib
<2024-01-27 Sat> Got that done a few days ago
*** DONE Change suffix (and emacs mode) of preprocess files so that warnings go away when building docs
<2024-01-27 Sat> this is a moot point after https://github.com/billsix/modelviewprojection/commit/93daf37105890952ad3d2bc983f1f011927506ce
*** DONE develop better name other that "begin" "end"

**** <2023-11-02 Thu>
Got through demo 06.  Nofmt is nice to format the transformation pipeline as I see fit.

*** DONE Rewrite Hearn Baker code
<2024-01-27 Sat> Not gonna do this anymore.  Sam left the univerity, and I don't like the code from this book.
It'd be better to do for craft

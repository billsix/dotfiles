*** TODO [#1] Miscellaneous stuff around the kitchenette put away or thrown away so that it is not visible.
*** TODO [#10] If you have time and motivation, organize the cords in the entertainment center.  Doesn't have to be perfect, just needs to be better than it is.

*** DONE Each basket of kids' clothes to appropriate bed.  Make them put it away.  Take baskets back to laundry room.
*** TODO Clean-up and organize your computer desk

** TODO Office (15-20 minutes, max, for you, plus 10ish minutes for and with the kids) [66%]
*** TODO [#2] The kids' bins - have the kids put the stuff AWAY.  This may require you taking one kid at a time and following them around (basement, bathroom, bedroom) to put the stuff away.  Most of that stuff has been there since you put it in the bins.  These are meant to be staging areas, not collection bins.

*** TODO [#3] The "subject to purge" bin in the labeled rolling cart thing - re-allocate to appropriate other bins, or actually purge.
*** DONE Stuff off tops of bookshelves - stick it in a cabinet, or take it downstairs and put it on the bigger shelves there
*** DONE Your bin of miscellany - please figure it out - I feel like things go there to die.
*** DONE The shelves with controllers, half of which I haven't seen anyone touch in the entire time we've been dating: do these all need to live upstairs, or can they go in the basement?  If not, or if some must live upstairs, can they live in the (currently) empty drawer in the shelves with the games?  I feel like this shelf is just a dust-catcher and another place for the kids to throw random things (I've picked so many food wrappers and small toys off of these shelves).  If the shelves end up empty, please break down and move to the basement storage room with the other parts.

*** TODO Shelf he is using as a precarious desk to the basement and in the base of Adam's shelf.  Let's discuss later whether he needs some other flat surface to sit at (I don't think he does but could be convinced otherwise), but if that shelf falls on a foot, it's going to be a couple broken toes.

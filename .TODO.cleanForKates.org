* TODO Indoor [%]
** TODO Basement [%]
*** TODO Each basket of kids' clothes to appropriate bed.  Make them put it away.  Take baskets back to laundry room.
*** TODO Donation items moved to bin in dining room
*** TODO Adam's Monster Smash (or whatever) stuff in the storage area.
*** TODO Clean-up and organize your computer desk
*** TODO Clean-up and organize all of your music-y stuff.  Drum sticks off floor.
*** TODO Miscellaneous stuff around the kitchenette put away or thrown away so that it is not visible.
*** TODO Extra shelf parts currently on the floor in a ziploc baggie or some other receptacle to be stored in laundry room/storage area.
*** TODO Extra shelf to shed (built or not doesn't matter at this point)
*** TODO If you have time and motivation, organize the cords in the entertainment center.  Doesn't have to be perfect, just needs to be better than it is.

** TODO  Kitchen [%]
*** TODO Crap off of tops of shelves
-->Pans in the cabinet.  Stick a few paper towels in the cast iron (so it doesn't get scratched) and add it to a stack of pots or something.  Lid off the wok, stack it under the frying pans I bought, add the lid on top.
-->Any plastic wrap or related stuff - cabinet under the air fryer or basement kitchenette (in cabinets that you will CLOSE!!!)
-->HVAC filters to basement storage room

*** TODO Fish tank aquarium thing - to the basement

** TODO Office (15-20 minutes, max, for you, plus 10ish minutes for and with the kids) [%]
*** TODO Stuff off tops of bookshelves - stick it in a cabinet, or take it downstairs and put it on the bigger shelves there
*** TODO Your bin of miscellany - please figure it out - I feel like things go there to die.
*** TODO The shelves with controllers, half of which I haven't seen anyone touch in the entire time we've been dating: do these all need to live upstairs, or can they go in the basement?  If not, or if some must live upstairs, can they live in the (currently) empty drawer in the shelves with the games?  I feel like this shelf is just a dust-catcher and another place for the kids to throw random things (I've picked so many food wrappers and small toys off of these shelves).  If the shelves end up empty, please break down and move to the basement storage room with the other parts.
*** TODO The "subject to purge" bin in the labeled rolling cart thing - re-allocate to appropriate other bins, or actually purge.
*** TODO Your bin - please put your stuff away, where it belongs.
*** TODO The kids' bins - have the kids put the stuff AWAY.  This may require you taking one kid at a time and following them around (basement, bathroom, bedroom) to put the stuff away.  Most of that stuff has been there since you put it in the bins.  These are meant to be staging areas, not collection bins.

*** TODO Toys (closet, floor) and bins to the basement; toys on his shelf; bins in the storage area
*** TODO Shelf he is using as a precarious desk to the basement and in the base of Adam's shelf.  Let's discuss later whether he needs some other flat surface to sit at (I don't think he does but could be convinced otherwise), but if that shelf falls on a foot, it's going to be a couple broken toes.

** TODO Kate & Adam's Room [%]
*** TODO Heap of blankets in closet to the laundry room.  No idea how clean or dirty they are; they need to be washed and put away better, which I can do when I'm there
*** TODO Adam's toys to Adam's shelf in the basement

** TODO Kids' Bathroom [%]
*** TODO There are literally 9 tubes of open toothpaste for 3 children, and well more than 3 toothbrushes.  WTF.  Figure out who uses what, leave one tube of each, kidnap the others, and put them on my desk.  We will figure out where to put them to have them RATIONED back out as tubes are actually emptied. Discard excess toothbrushes.
